# Student-Chess-Games

## Project overview
- Analyze my student's overall perfomance (rapid games)
- Elo graph and Win rates 
- Presentation and Dashboard 
- Tools: Google Sheets, Google Slides, Data Studio

## Prepare phase
Downloaded the data from lichess.org. The games were in .pgn format, so i found
a cool script to import them in google sheets!

## Process Phase
The data shown are completely raw as downloaded in .xlsx. You can access them in this link **[Link](https://github.com/DimKaisaris/Student-Chess-Games/blob/main/Raw%20Files/Copy%20of%20lichess.org.xlsx)**

To clean the data I follow the steps from the **[Copy of Cleaning Log](https://github.com/DimKaisaris/Student-Chess-Games/blob/main/Processed%20Files/Copy%20of%20Cleaning%20Log.docx)**
and all changes which I make during the Process and Analysis Phases I record them in the **[Change Log Tzimas.K](https://github.com/DimKaisaris/Student-Chess-Games/blob/main/Processed%20Files/Change%20Log%20Tzimas.K.docx)**

## Analysis Phase 
To extract valuable information, many simple and advanced functions were used. Many charts and pivot tables were created as well.
Take a look at the final spreadsheet as uploaded in .xlsx format if you wish **[Rapid Games(K. Tzimas)](https://github.com/DimKaisaris/Student-Chess-Games/blob/main/Processed%20Files/Rapid%20Games%20(K.%20Tzimas).xlsx)**
