# Student-Chess-Games Analysis

## Project overview

This project focuses on analyzing my student's performance in rapid chess games. The analysis includes:  
- Overall Performance Evaluation: Assessing the student's progress and game outcomes.
- Elo Rating and Win Rate Visualization: Creating graphs and charts to display the student's Elo rating development and win/loss statistics.
- Presentation and Interactive Dashboard: Developing a presentation and an interactive dashboard to effectively communicate the analysis findings. 
Tools Used: Google Sheets, Google Slides, Google Data Studio, Power BI.

## Prepare phase
Downloaded the data from lichess.org. The games were in .pgn format, so I found
a cool script to import them in google sheets!

## Process Phase
The data shown are completely raw as uploaded in .xlsx. You can access them in this link **[Link](https://github.com/DimKaisaris/Student-Chess-Games/blob/main/Raw%20Files/Copy%20of%20lichess.org.xlsx)**

To clean the data I follow the steps from the **[Copy of Cleaning Log](https://github.com/DimKaisaris/Student-Chess-Games/blob/main/Processed%20Files/Copy%20of%20Cleaning%20Log.docx)**
and all changes which I make during the Process and Analysis Phases I record them in the **[Change Log Tzimas.K](https://github.com/DimKaisaris/Student-Chess-Games/blob/main/Processed%20Files/Change%20Log%20Tzimas.K.docx)**

## Analysis Phase 
To extract valuable information, many simple and advanced functions were used. Many charts and pivot tables were created as well.
Take a look at the final spreadsheet as uploaded in .xlsx format if you wish **[Rapid Games(K. Tzimas)](https://github.com/DimKaisaris/Student-Chess-Games/blob/main/Processed%20Files/Rapid%20Games%20(K.%20Tzimas).xlsx)**

## Share Phase
To Share the results I created a **[presentation](https://github.com/DimKaisaris/Student-Chess-Games/blob/main/Presentation/Rapid%20Games%20presentation(%20tzimask).pptx)**
and a dashboard in DataStudio. Use [Link](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/ab756547-d965-45d4-8413-0c212b0b4f1e/page/qK2eC) to visit!
