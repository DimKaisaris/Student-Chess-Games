# Student-Chess-Games

## Project overview

- Elo graph and Win rates 
- Presentation and Dashboard 
- Tools: Google Sheets, Google Slides, Data Studio

## Prepare phase
Downloaded the data from lichess.org. The games were in .pgn format, so i found
a cool script to import them in google sheets!

## Process Phase
The data shown are completely raw as downloaded in .xlsx. You can access them in this link **[Link](https://github.com/DimKaisaris/Student-Chess-Games/blob/main/Raw%20Files/Copy%20of%20lichess.org.xlsx)**
